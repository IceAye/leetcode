// ‚ùì DESCRIPTION:
// There are n rings and each ring is either red, green, or blue. The rings are distributed across ten rods labeled from 0 to 9.
// You are given a string rings of length 2n that describes the n rings that are placed onto the rods.
// Every two characters in rings forms a color-position pair that is used to describe each ring where:
// The first character of the ith pair denotes the ith ring's color ('R', 'G', 'B').
// The second character of the ith pair denotes the rod that the ith ring is placed on ('0' to '9').
//
// üìå For example, "R3G2B1" describes n == 3 rings: a red ring placed onto the rod labeled 3,
// a green ring placed onto the rod labeled 2, and a blue ring placed onto the rod labeled 1.
//
// Return the number of rods that have all three colors of rings on them.
//
